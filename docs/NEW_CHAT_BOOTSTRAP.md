# New Chat Session Bootstrap Protocol

This document defines the mandatory discovery and re-anchoring procedure for newly launched chat sessions or agents interacting with the TypeFirst repository.

## 1. Capability Gate

Before making any claims about repository status, determine whether tools providing direct local repository access (e.g. terminal execution, file inspection) and GitHub access (e.g. `gh` CLI) are available in the current runtime environment:
- **If repository access tools are available**: Execute the live discovery commands below. Never assume or rely on remembered chat history.
- **If repository access tools are NOT available**: State clearly that live repository state cannot be verified directly. Never fabricate or extrapolate repository facts without tool access.

---

## 2. Live Discovery & Re-Anchoring Sequence

When starting a new session with repository access, execute the following inspection steps in order:

### Step 1: Verify Local Git State
Inspect the canonical checkout at `C:\Dev\TypeFirst`:
```powershell
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git status
git branch -a -vv
git log -1 --format=fuller
git worktree list
```
Verify:
- Repository root is `C:\Dev\TypeFirst`.
- Current checked-out branch.
- Current HEAD commit SHA.
- Working tree and index status (clean vs. uncommitted modifications).
- Untracked files.
- Active worktrees (ensure single normal worktree).

### Step 2: Verify Remote State & Upstream Synchronization
```powershell
git remote -v
gh repo view Tachiguro/TypeFirst --json defaultBranchRef,isPrivate,visibility,url
gh pr list --state open
gh pr list --state merged --limit 10
```
Verify:
- Remote `origin` points to `Tachiguro/TypeFirst`.
- Remote default branch (`master`).
- Remote tracking status and unpushed commits (`git log origin/master..HEAD` or upstream).
- Open Pull Requests on GitHub.
- Relevant recently merged Pull Requests to understand recent baseline integration.

### Step 3: Read Foundational Governance
Read the essential governance documents:
1. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
2. [docs/NEW_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP.md](NEW_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP.md)
3. [docs/PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md)
4. [docs/CURRENT_WORK.md](CURRENT_WORK.md)

## 3. Active Package Resolution Priority

To determine what package is currently in flight or what should happen next, evaluate sources in strict priority order:

1. **Open Active Pull Request**: An open PR on GitHub indicates a package in candidate/review/merge phase.
2. **Local Task Branch with Checkpoint Commits**: A dedicated task branch diverging from `master` with unpushed checkpoint commits indicates active in-flight implementation.
3. **`docs/CURRENT_WORK.md`**: Operational evidence of active package context and lifecycle phase.

> [!NOTE]
> The absence of an open Pull Request does NOT prove that there is no active work. An in-flight task branch or local slice implementation may be actively progressing.

---

## 4. Determining the Next Work Item

- If live state matches an active package (open PR, active task branch, or `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md`), report the exact verified package and its current lifecycle phase.
- If all branches are merged, working tree is clean on `master`, and no package is active in `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md`, state:
  > **"There is currently no clearly determined next work item."**
- **Strict Prohibition**: Agents must NEVER autonomously pick or invent new feature packages without explicit user instruction and prompt dispatch.

---

## 5. Current Verified Candidate Snapshot

- **Repository**: `Tachiguro/TypeFirst`
- **Canonical Path**: `C:\Dev\TypeFirst`
- **Default Branch**: `master`
- **Worktrees**: Exactly one normal worktree
- **Status**: Repository bootstrap completed
